:eql: https://edn-query-language.org/eql/1.0.0/specification.html
:fbook: https://book.fulcrologic.com/

This book demonstrates how to use the tools Fulcro offers to solve various real-life problems, with realistic examples.

https://fulcro-community.github.io/fulcro-cookbook/[Read the Cookbook here] and look at `cookbook.adoc` for the source.

See link:CONTRIBUTING.adoc[CONTRIBUTING.adoc] for details, and <<Writing tips>> below for practical advice.

== Writing tips

Use VS Code with asciidoctor plugin with link:https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-vscode#diagram-integration[Kroki enabled] (`asciidoc.extensions.enableKroki: true`, already enabled for this workspace).

Images and wireframes - use e.g. https://excalidraw.com/

Have a look at https://gist.github.com/dcode/0cfbf2699a1fe9b46ff04c41721dda74

If you want to include custom CSS, JS, or something else in the generated page - have a look at https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/docinfo/[Asciidoc Docinfo files].

=== Excalidraw images

When including these, set the attributes `,100%opts=inline` so that the image is not too broad and fonts show correctly (also check that you have `:stylesheet: cookbook.css` at the top of your document, see `index.adoc` for an example):

```
image::./recipes-ui.svg["UI wireframes",100%,opts=inline]
```

TIP: Asciidoctor's docs recommend to remove `width, height` from the SVG, and only leave `viewBox` there.


=== Previewing

If VS Code preview is not enough, you can use `asciidoctor` to generate the HTML and open it in a browser. With Babashka:

```shell
bb render
```

then open e.g. `cookbook/dynamic-recursion/dynamic-recursion.html` in a browser.

Limitations: Source code highlighting seems currently not working.

=== Code

We use Fulcro https://github.com/awkay/workspaces[workspaces] to be able to run and thus test the code of examples:

1. Add the parent directory of your code example to the `:paths` in `deps.edn`
2. Run `yarn install` and `shadow-cljs watch workspaces`
3. Access http://localhost:9001, select the "card" you want to see (and perhaps, in its â ‡ menu, select "Solo" to see it in max size)
4. Use the card's [Inspector] button to open Fulcro Inspect in its context

=== Problems and limitations

* VS Code preview of included SVG images requires Light Mode to work well, as they are almost invisible in the dark mode.
